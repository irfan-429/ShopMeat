<div class="entry-content">
    <p style="text-align: justify;">It all started back in 2020 when Two people from different state met at a restaurant,one is just returned from Dubai (Akash Ali) and other one is doing the tour and travel business (Sultan Ali) and decided they wanted to make life easier by changing the way India eats - all with just a tap! With their idea of ’hyperlocal meat delivery’, all they needed was the tech to power it and were introduced to Mohd Akram Qureshi, who brought this vision to life with the first website. And with this, Shopmeats was launched as a meat ordering & delivery platform.</p>
